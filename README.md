# diffusion_models
Final project for CPSC 550. This repository contains code and samples for generating data from the MNIST dataset. After training on 12,552,848 parameters for 2000 epochs with a batch size of 1000 on my RTX 4070 graphics card (combined total of 8 hours of training), most of the generated samples look indishtinguishable from a human written digit.
